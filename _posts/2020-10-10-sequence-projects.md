Question: Which type of project is most likely to be used and reused in other projects?

- [x] &nbsp;  Sequence
- [ ] &nbsp;  Flow Chart
- [ ] &nbsp;  State Machine
- [ ] &nbsp;  Global Exception Handler

## Answer

Sequence projects are intended to be small, reusable pieces of logic that can be used in other sequence projects, flow chart projects and state machine projects.

> Sequences are the smallest type of project. They are suitable to linear processes as they enable you to go from one activity to another seamlessly, and act as a single block activity.
