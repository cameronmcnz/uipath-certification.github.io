# UiPath Exam Objectives

If you are interested in taking the UiPath Associate exam, the first thing to do is go over the UiPath exam objectives and figure out where you are weak and where you are strong. Then, focus your studies accordingly.

## Robotic Process Automation (UiPath and RPA) Fundamentals
- Differentiate between the UiPath Studio Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition
- Identify sample use cases that describes the processes and workloads that can be automated
- Identify and describe the different types of robots, i.e., attended versus unattended robots
- Explain the functionality of the various UiPath products, i.e., Studio, Robots, and Orchestrator

The following tutorial from TheServerSide will help you reinforce your knowledge of the UiPath and RPA Funcamentals section of the UiPath Certification Exam:

## UiPath Studio Overview
- Understand and explain the automation debug functions and usage such as Breakpoints
- Identify and describe how to use Manage Packages
- Explain the significance of connecting an automation project to the version control solution

Here's a UiPath Youtube tutorial to get you started with UiPath Studio:
